						The anticipation of fans on the release of "Attack on Titan" Season 2 has been building up for some time. Recent reports though have indicated that "A.O.T" Season 2 will be finally released on the last quarter of 2016 that is if everything goes according to their plans.

					<h2>'Attack on Titan' Season 2 ongoing Production</h2>

					<h1>Naruto manga has ended?</h1>

					</p>
					<p>
						Much like the Epilogue from Harry Potter, Naruto's creator Masashi Kishimoto may have given fans too much information—at least about the utimate fates of the main trio and their lives in the future.
