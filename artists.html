					<h1>Eiichiro Oda</h1>
					<img class="artist-profile" src="img/artists/oda/eiichiro-oda.jpg">
					<p>
						Eiichiro Oda (尾田 栄一郎 Oda Eiichirō, born January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist, best known for his manga series One Piece (1997–present). With over 345 million copies in circulation worldwide, One Piece is the best-selling manga series of all time. The series' popularity resulted in him being named one of the manga artists that changed the history of manga.
					</p>
					<p>
						Eiichiro Oda claimed that at age four he resolved to become a manga artist in order to avoid having to get a "real job". His biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball. He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled Vicky the Viking. He submitted a character named Pandaman for Yudetamago's classic wrestling manga Kinnikuman. Pandaman was not only used in a chapter of the manga but would later return as a recurring cameo character in Oda's own works.
